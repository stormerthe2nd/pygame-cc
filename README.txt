city cycling game with python's pygame library,
open the main.py file if you want to take a look, modify or run the source code
or else have the exe file if you dont have python and it's essential modules(pygame, numpy)
already installed to run the script,
NOTE: the exe file is currently unable to display fonts however the game does run properly
:)
